# FatManBoo
FatMan Boo was a iPhone Game I have made 2014 with Level/SVG. It wa quite a success, especially in Asia.
As I mentioned in my blog at wwww.rogerboesch.com, I have removed all Apps or Games from the AppStore,
which have in July 2016 either less then 1000 downloads per month or generated less then 1000 USD per month.
Except FatMan Boo which is still available but now also Public Source.

## Important
The game is based on Cocos2D and LevelSVG, which are both outdated. So to make them running again, it needs some
work. Feel free to use code in every way you want. If you made updates, please also contribute to this repo, 
so others can use it as well.

Art is just allowed for own usage. Distribution and use in AppStore and GooglePlay not allowed.
