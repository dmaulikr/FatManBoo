# FatManBoo
FatMan Boo was one iPhone Game i have made with Level/SVG. It wa quite a success, especially in Asia.
As i mentioned in my blog at wwww.rogerboesch.com, i have removed all Apps or Games from the AppStore,
which have in July 2016 either less then 1000 downloads per month or generated less then 1000 USD per month.
FatMan Boo is one of this.

## Important
The game is based on Cocos2D and LevelSVG, which are both outdated. So to make them running again, it needs some
work. Feel free to use code in every way you want. 

Art is just allowed for own usage. Distribution and use in AppStore and GooglePlay not allowed.
